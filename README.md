E-commerce Data Analysis

Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization on e-commerce transaction data using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data cleaning, and formatting.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing customer demographics, purchase patterns, and sales trends.

Data Visualization: Using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to generate insightful charts.

Customer Segmentation: Implementing RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to classify customers.

Sales Performance Analysis: Identifying top-selling products, revenue trends, and seasonal variations.

Correlation Analysis: Understanding relationships between different variables.

Technologies Used
